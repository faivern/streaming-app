title: Link IMDB rating to IMDB page in media detail
area: ui

## Problem

The IMDB rating displayed in media detail is not clickable. Users should be able to click on the rating to navigate directly to the IMDB page for that movie/show.

## Solution

TBD - Make the IMDB rating component a link that opens the corresponding IMDB page (using the IMDB ID from TMDB data) in a new tab.

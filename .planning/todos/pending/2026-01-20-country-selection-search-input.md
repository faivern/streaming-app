title: Add search input to country selection menu
area: ui

## Problem

The country selection menu requires scrolling through a long list of countries to find the desired one. This is slow and frustrating for users.

## Solution

TBD - Add a search/filter input at the top of the country selection dropdown that filters the country list as the user types.

title: Click outside user-panel should close it and restyle like genres-modal
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

1. The user panel doesn't close when clicking outside of it - missing standard modal/dropdown behavior
2. The UI coloring of the user panel needs to be updated to match the visual style of the genres modal menu for consistency

## Solution

TBD - Add click-outside handler to user panel component and update styling to match genres-modal-menu appearance (colors, shadows, borders).

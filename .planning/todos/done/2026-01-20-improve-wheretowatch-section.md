title: Improve where-to-watch section UX
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

The where-to-watch section needs several UX improvements:
- Placement could be better
- Missing pricing information with currency display
- Provider logos only show tooltip on hover - should also display name visibly
- No direct links to the streaming sites

## Solution

TBD - Enhance the where-to-watch component with:
- Better positioning/layout
- Fetch and display pricing with appropriate currency (if available from JustWatch/TMDB)
- Show provider name on hover in addition to tooltip (or replace tooltip)
- Add clickable links to streaming provider sites
